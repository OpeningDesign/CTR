<u>Basement</u>

*   Utility room on the north of the building, if coming on oxford than we should put next to oxford on west side of building.

    *   Hot water heaters will be in the utility room correct?

    *   Where do we have area for a small maintenance area?

*   Add where we can, bike hanging mechanism on walls in front of parking spots.

*   Rename bike room to “Secured Bike Room”

*   Where are the heating “hang” units in the basement?

*   Where is the venting

*   Is there room for a passageway next to the ramp with a door with FOB access going down for bikers?

*   Maybe don’t extend the garage beyond the building on the south side of the building?

    *   Will we lose spots? If so how many spots.

*   Security cameras in the basement so that they feel safe

*   LED lighting in the garages

*   Maintanence personnel room for little tinkering and small projects

<u>1</u><sup><u>st</u></sup> <u>floor</u>

*   Add in vestibule on first floor.

*   Glass on the office to look into the lobby

*   Desk with two chairs in the office

*   Welcome screen

*   Windows in lobby and community room facing courtyard

*   Add Mailboxes in the lobby along the western wall of the lobby next to the elevator.

<u>All floors</u>

*   Redesign the two bedrooms to flow better and have the living rooms on the corners not the bedrooms. You never get a second chance to make a first impression. We don’t want them to walk immediately into a wall when entering those units.

*   Get rid of the tubs in the ones and studios

*   Full stackable washer/dryers

*   Is the contractor okay with the sink in the island? Ask royal.

*   Design pull shades for the sliding doors that block 85% of light

*   Have royal construction look into Amish cabinets

*   Ceiling fans in all living room as well as master bedroom in 2-bedrooms.

*   Add cabinet above the toilets

*   Put in little outcoves for the residences in the hallway corridors

*   Look into stacking the balconies on second and third floors

*   Square off the storage units on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> floor 1 bedrooms and add that to their square feet

*   Combine closets (currently back-to-back) in 1-bedroom units for a larger bedroom closet

*   Make the counters in the studios an L shape?

*   Translucent transom in studio, where the gap would be on the top of the wall facing the outdoor windows from living room. This will help a little more light to get through to the bedroom but also aid in the privacy. Furthermore, see if we can add a sliding “barn” door to the entrance of the studio bedrooms.

*   Make storage units on first floor in wasted space next to both staircases

<u>**Management Points**</u>

*   One central meter, should we get a submetering system?

    *   Look into the water heater

    *   Put this into the lease

    *   Heating with gas

    *   Bill back for water and sewer

*   Controlled access

*   Price the units out according to river views and courtyard

*   Second and third floor need to be priced higher on the river side
