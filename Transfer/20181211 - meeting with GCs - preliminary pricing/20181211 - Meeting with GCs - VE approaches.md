- VE
	- A10 Foundations
		- Bringing the perimeter of the exterior foundation walls in alignment with the perimeter of the 1st floor exterior walls would eliminate the need for deck water proofing
			- Would make the basement SF go down as well.
	- B10 Superstructure
		- Floor
			- By having the 1st floor unit layout match the 2nd and 3rd floors, (verses 3bds) we can eliminate the need for steel on the 2nd floor to transfer loads down to the precast
		- Roof

			- Use exterior gutters and box downspouts
			- Use TPO membrane instead of EPDM.
			- Wasn't discussed in the meetings, but I'm sure if the roof overhang was remove, it would lower costs.
		- Stairs
			- CMU cores throughout the 4 floors, most likely more cost effective than wood and CMU in the basement.
			- Use a ship's ladder and roof hatch verses extending the stair to the roof.
			- We can also eliminate the middle stair, next to the elevator, all together.  It is not required code-wise.
	- B20 Ext. Vert Enclosure
		- Walls
			- Panelize exterior wall
				- Use engineered wall panels--19.5" o.c. studs.
			- Fiber cement? large panels
				- Jim, for Royal seemed to think using these large fiber cement panels would be same cost, or less than using EIFS.
				- Jay, for Hoeft thought EIFS would be a more cost effective than the fiber cement.
			- structural insulated sheathing
				- Jim, recommend using the Zip system. http://www.huberwood.com/zipsystem/home-zip-system
			- Polycarbonate
				- Use as more of an accent throughout building, due to cost.
			- Perforated panel at magic pack
				- Jim indicated that the verticality of the large facade panels would make it easier to hide the magic paks within the design of the facade.
		- Windows
			- Jay seemed to think breaking down the tall casement windows into (2) vertically staked mulled units would be more cost effective. 
			- Jim, indicated that mulling the windows vertically wouldn't necessary save any costs.  Indicated that there might be a cost savings with using alum. storefront windows at these conditions.
		- Balconies
			- Have the balconies be self draining--since they are not stacked vertically floor to floor.
			- Have their structure be an extension of the floor trusses vs. hang from the facade.
	- C20 Interior Finishes
		- flooring
			- Carpet in rooms & main areas
			- Vinyl plank in living areas.
	- D10 Conveying
		- There would be some cost savings with using a one sided elevator.  Perhaps we can explore a ramp at or near the lobby to navigate the 30" plinth elevation.
