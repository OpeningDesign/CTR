This report describes the calculation procedure and data considered in order to design the foundation of a new apartment building in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

The construction consists in a three-story apartment building with a first-floor footprint of about 19,500 square feet, a below-grade parking garage with a footprint of about 27,200 square feet, perimeter retaining walls, a slab-on-grade, and a conventional foundation system.

The first floor system is precast hollow core concrete plank on precast beams and columns. For the upper floors and roof, the system is wood-framed. Retaining walls and slab on grade are comprised of cast in place concrete, except for three reinforced CMU walls next to the garage aisles, that will be demolished during the second phase of construction.

The foundation uses conventional cast in place concrete footings to transfer axial compression and lateral loads to the ground.
