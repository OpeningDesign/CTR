- Changes since last plan
	- Added corridor on the 1st floor
	- added community room and office area
	- moved car ramp northward
		- has 20% slope to avoid headroom conflict at corridor. 
- Construction type
	- 1st-3rd floors: Type VB
	- Basement and Car Ramp: Type 1A (3hr separation between Type VB and 1A)
	- Stairs: 2hr rated
		- assuming CMU walls. best option?
		- ext. stair at elevator, common wall only needs to be 2hr rated
	- Sprinklers (NFPA 13) throughout all floors
- Panelized Facade
	- The concept is to refine the facade down to a handful of standard panel sizes that can be craned into place.
		- Hope to include finish materials, as well, in the 'panel'.  Needs AEC coordination.  
	- Might go without say, but it's intended that all exterior walls throughout the project will resemble those illustrated on sheet A200--including balconies.  The floor plans to do reflect this, due to time constraints. 
- Polycarbonate
	- System includes simple aluminum profiles at the jambs and head/sill.  The studs on the interior side, will be placed at every panel seam (500mm), with metal clips from the stud to the panel to provide lateral support.
		- Looking to have a higher grade wood stud on the interior, as these studs would be a finish material.
	- Due to code restrictions, there will be less polycarbonate panels used throughout the facade than is illustrated on sheet A200.  Exact reduction is still pending.
		- 	Will most likely replace with full-height (10ft) cement fiber panels, ripped to standard dimensions to avoid as much waste as possible
	- Looking to use, arcoPlus 547(500mm): http://gallinausa.com/arcoplus/arcoplus-547/

- Accessibility
	- 3 units of Type A w/out roll in showers
	- 1 unit of Type A w/ roll in showers
	- rest Type B

- Roof
	- proposing a rubber/plastic roof
		- suggested material?
	- looking to slope with the trusses
	- exterior box gutters/downspouts
		- will work into the design of the facade
- Floors
	- 1st floor pre-cast (3hr rating)
	- 2nd & 3rd Floors: Wood truss (30mins)
		- typical STC rating for multifamily
- Walls
	- typical 2x party walls w/ typical fire/STC rating for multifamily
	- typical 2x corridor walls w/ typical fire/STC rating for multifamily
- Elevator and/or shafts
	- Double sided elevator.
	- 2 hr rated shaft
	- assuming CMU
		- Best option?
- Windows
	- Alum. casements
		- Vinyl if a cost issue.  Open to suggestions.
	- since floor to ceiling, will need some type of railing system inside for fall protection. 
		- Assuming a cable system 
- Decks - 1st floor
	- Assuming we can cantilever the 1st floor precast over the foundation.
	- assuming composite decking over sloped membrane/drainage system over precast.
	- assuming 2x treated framing at the front of decks
	- most areas do not need a railing as the elevation change is less than 30".
- Balconies
	- Cantilevered floor truss structure
		- treated 2x's
	- Balcony self draining, that is, no internal drains
- Courtyard
	- At patios near units: assuming composite decking over sloped membrane/drainage system over precast.
	- Other areas (layout t.b.d)
		- Pavers over sloped membrane/drainage system over precast.
		- Artifical turf  over sloped membrane/drainage system over precast.
- HVAC
	- Magic-Paks at exterior walls



- Zoning: Central Business Plan Development
- 20ft, but shooting for 10ft
	- will require more landscaping
- Sideyard: 8ft
- Ramp: 15% slope max
	- Building code?
- Include Trash
- Questions
	- What's the schedule of events?
		- Drawings?
	- Survey?
	- Civil?
		- Landscape Architect

- VE
	- A10 Foundations
		- Bringing the perimeter of the exterior foundation walls in alignment with the perimeter of the 1st floor exterior walls would eliminate the need for deck water proofing
			- Would make the basement SF go down as well.
	- B10 Superstructure
		- Floor
			- By having the 1st floor unit layout match the 2nd and 3rd floors, (verses 3bds) we can eliminate the need for steel on the 2nd floor to transfer loads down to the precast
		- Roof

			- Use exterior gutters and box downspouts
			- Use TPO membrane instead of EPDM.
			- Wasn't discussed in the meetings, but I'm sure if the roof overhang was remove, it would lower costs.
		- Stairs
			- [ ] - CMU cores throughout the 4 floors, most likely more cost effective than wood and CMU in the basement.
			- Use a ship's ladder and roof hatch verses extending the stair to the roof.
			- We can also eliminate the middle stair, next to the elevator, all together.  It is not required code-wise.
	- B20 Ext. Vert Enclosure
		- Walls
			- Panelize exterior wall
				- Use engineered wall panels--19.5" o.c. studs.
			- Fiber cement? large panels
				- Jim, for Royal seemed to think using these large fiber cement panels would be same cost, or less than using EIFS.
				- Jay, for Hoeft thought EIFS would be a more cost effective than the fiber cement.
			- structural insulated sheathing
				- Jim, recommend using the Zip system. http://www.huberwood.com/zipsystem/home-zip-system
			- Polycarbonate
				- Use as more of an accent throughout building, due to cost.
			- Perforated panel at magic pack
				- Jim indicated that the verticality of the large facade panels would make it easier to hide the magic paks within the design of the facade.
		- Windows
			- Jay seemed to think breaking down the tall casement windows into (2) vertically staked mulled units would be more cost effective. 
			- Jim, indicated that mulling the windows vertically wouldn't necessary save any costs.  Indicated that there might be a cost savings with using alum. storefront windows at these conditions.
		- Balconies
			- Have the balconies be self draining--since they are not stacked vertically floor to floor.
			- Have their structure be an extension of the floor trusses vs. hang from the facade.
	- C20 Interior Finishes
		- flooring
			- Carpet in rooms & main areas
			- Vinyl plank in living areas.
	- D10 Conveying
		- There would be some cost savings with using a one sided elevator.  Perhaps we can explore a ramp at or near the lobby to navigate the 30" plinth elevation.




- Bank of mail boxes
- roof for mail - shelves per floor.


- load bearing walls inside a 3 unit?
