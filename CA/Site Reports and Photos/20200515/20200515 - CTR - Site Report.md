- At Stairs
  
  - need (3) SDWS22600DB - SDWS STRUCTURAL SCREWS @ EACHVERTICAL STUD at the ledgers that bear multiple joists
  
  - need (2) SDWS22600DB - SDWS STRUCTURAL SCREWS @ EACH VERTICAL STUD at ledgers that do not bear joists

- Add additional sistered studs at column near LVL at elevator on 1st floor
  
  - <img src="2020-05-18-17-37-17-image.png" title="" alt="" width="439">

- At 3rd floor stair: Not enough room to slide (2) layers of drywall and 1/2" resilent channel between truss and stud.  Either move the truss or wrap truss with (2) layers of 5/8" Gyp. Bd--to continue 2hr wall up to deck.
  
  - <img src="14.13.54-3rd floor at roof near stair.jpg" title="" alt="" width="461">

- Spacing of 4x6's at roof at/near stair is incorrect.  Need to be 24" o.c. at stair. 16" o.c. outside stair at corrido--to support the condensing units on the roof.
